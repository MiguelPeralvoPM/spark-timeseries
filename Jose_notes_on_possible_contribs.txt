Autoregression.scala
1 - factor out code for removeTimeDependentEffects and addTimeDependentEffects
    - time comparison
	- can we replace while wiht fold?
	
Garch.scala
2 - Robust standard error calculations
3 - smart initialization of GARCH models
4 - EGARCH implementation....(ambitious)

TimeSeries.scala
1 - seems to me that in union we don't need to have c to c, can simplify? check implications
2 - timeseries filter ?
3 - apply with row as date, y as only those labels?
4 - should differences(0) return a vector of 0.0 of the same length (this seems because of breeze.linalg._)? and shouldn't it be index.size, for the slice, not index.size - 1


UnivariateTimeSeries.scala
added fillNext (as fill forward)
added fillPrev (as fill backward)
added fillWithDefault

TimeSeriesStatisticalTests.scala
added breusch godfrey test
-->need to add RSE (using huber white sandwich)

add tests

issues:


val src = Source.fromFile("/Users/josecambronero/r_data_ar.csv")
val data = src.getLines().map(_.split(",")).drop(1).map(x => x.map(_.toDouble)).toArray
val Array(x, y, y2) = data.transpose //x, y(stationary), y2(AR(1))
